In a land far far away, no one really knows where but this place definitly exist but you know no one's seen it, but it's there maybe idk OMG are all fairy tales lies. #childhood ruined, brothers grimm how could you lie to me so easily? Is santa even real? well of course he is I mean there is no way my parents bought all those presents. Well let's get back to the story. There once lived a young man, he wasn't anything special just a farmer boy, but he was about to embark on an adventure. One cold winter night a old women came to his house, but before she ever reached the house she fell head first into the snow, the young man (being the hero of the story) ran out to help her and pick her up, but the second he arrived close to the old hag, she vanished. the boy kinda creeped out decided to not think  about it to much so he turned around to head home, but as he turned around he noticed that his house had dissapeared, and he was all alone in the cold dark night. The moral of this story is never trust anyone and never ever help people in need. you're welcome.
